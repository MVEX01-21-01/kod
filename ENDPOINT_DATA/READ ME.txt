Concerning the data:

The CALF_NORMAL file contains the data for the endpoints of the ENFs for 8 different healthy patients.
The CALF_MODERATE file contains the data for the endpoints of the ENFs for 7 different patients from the moderate neuropathy group.

The data are structured into a list with "ppp" objects as elements. 
You can read more about ppp object here: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spatstat/versions/1.64-1/topics/ppp.object
Every element of the list correspond to data from a different patient.

You can import the data into R with:
data = readRDS('path_to_the_data')

You can visualize the data with the plot function:
For example to visualize the point pattern of the first subject use plot(data[[1]))


The use of the spatstat library in R is highly reccomended.
